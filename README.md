# TS + Tailwind + Vite

## TLDR

Write your TS in [`src/main.ts`](./src/main.ts). From terminal, do: `npm start`...profit?

## How To Use

Click the green button that says 'Use this template'. It will fork it to your GitHub. From there, clone it to your computer and be sure to run `npm i` to install dependencies listed in `package.json`.

## TS Configuration

As per [`tsconfig.json`](./tsconfig.json), it's adhering to some stricter settings, basically what comes with Vite, including `vite-env.d.ts`, which enables some additional Intellisense for environment variables. Kindly consult the [Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#typescript) for more information about this, or just use it as is and focus on writing your code 👩🏾‍💻.

## Other Tooling 🧰

Linting and prettier are both provided. Adjust these as you see fit using the respective configuration files, of course.

There are also a few recommended VS Code extensions to make Prettier and ESLint work, along with Intellisense for Tailwind classes.

The `.vscode` directory also includes some recommended settings. These automatically format and organize imports any time you blur the file (lose focus or leave the file). In other words, it's highly automated and will change code on your behalf - almost always for the better. You my or may not want this level of automation. 🤷🏾‍♂️
